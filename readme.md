SyncTab
=======

## Welcome
This extension helps you manage tabs and reduce clutter. When you have a number of tabs open, and want to close them so you can restore them later, use SyncTab. 

SyncTab will create a new session and add the tabs. These SyncTab sessions are synchronized across all your chrom instances, including your phone. SyncTab uses Chrome's bookmarks behind the scene to manage its sessions.

This project is opensource. Your contributions and support are welcome!
